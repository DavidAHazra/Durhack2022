        <comment>My brother Ian and I worked in our holidays at Crimdon as Lifeguards with Maurice.He was British Lightweight Champion for three years and won a Lonsdale Belt outright.he was tremendously fit and had a quick left hand.Sadly he died of a heart attack in 2001 at the age of 64. He was a fun loving gentleman but probably should have gone down to London with a top manager.I saw him give an exhibition fight at the Midlands Sporting Club in 1964 ( Solihull) when I was a medical student in Birmingham. The audience threw over &#163;25.00 into the ring in half crowns as a token of their appreciation of his boxing skills.The local boxer from Smethwick had to be led into the shower afterwards by hand as both his eyes were swollen so much he could not see.</comment>

        <comment>NOT the Junior Mixed - I began school at Easington Infant Girls' School in around 1962. The Boys' and Girls' Schools were amalgamated (Mrs Knowles would not let us use the term 'mixed') somewhere around 1966/1967, I think.</comment>

        <comment>Just seen these pictures I was born in Essington Colliery 1924. I would like to see any pictures etc. from this period. I moved away in 1935, my father was in the brass band, and was the conductor of the newly formed jass band about that time. His name was William Glendenning. He worked in the pit like all other men of the time.Any info would be of interest, thanks in advance.</comment>

        <comment>I believe this photograph is my fathers - Albert Bradley1902 - father in law. Father of Evelyn Sutherland who died in 1951. He is a wittness on the wedding certificate and is named as Evelyns father. She is buried at Easington Colliery cemetery just in front of the gate offices about the 3rd row in. I also believe he is shown in a group photograph alongside my father although this photograph was taken about 25 years later.</comment>

        <comment>As his son, I can identify this as my father (extreme right of picture). I was not born until 1947 - but I have a copy of the print in my personal collection. The bass player is, I believe Billy Richardson, who later taught me to swim since he was an extremely strong swimmer, often competing in open-sea races.</comment>

        <comment>The shop on the corner was Walter Wilsons (now vacant), the shops behind included a haberdashers/ladies fashion (gone - converted to housing I think), a grocers/general store (now a hairdressers), a barbers (gone), a fish and chip shop (still open), a butchers (gone) and a selection of other buildings. The rows of houses to the left of the picture are the B streets - Byron, Browning, etc... I was a child when the photo was taken - and remember swinging on the railings by Walter Wilsons while my mum went in.</comment>

        <comment>The 'net' is for scooping sea coal from the beach. These men are working at the shore line collecting the coal waste that was dumped by the aerial flight. Each high tide would bring in fresh 'seams' of coal running the length of the beach, but competition was fierce especially during the strikes and winter and many didn't wait for the sea to go totally out before collecting. The result of this work would be cycles loaded with bags of sea coal as shown in a previous picture</comment>

        <comment>Letter written in 1979 to Jim Hughes by Harold Todd, describing his experiences as a member of a Rescue Brigade in the aftermath of the Easington Colliery Disaster in May 1951 It all started in 1941, I was employed at Wheatley Hill Colliery on a &#8216;Skip Face' doing datal work until the coal was filled off then maybe being sent onto the face to clean up for the cutters and to erect any timber that was missing. I then decided I would like to follow my three brothers footsteps and study for a deputy overman's certificate. Taking this decision I enrolled at a night school under the instruction of F Simpson the undermanager of the colliery. The examination was taken at Ryhope Secondary School. In November 1942 I started deputy work on the same skip face in the South Busty Seam and continued in the same seam for three and a half years until the seam hit a fault too large to get through. For the next one and a half years I was employed in the Top Hutton Seam, which was eighteen inches high making it very unpleasant to say the least. I stuck this for as long as I could and then left to work at Blackhall Colliery in September 1947. Being employed on long wall faces at Wheatley Hill I found the work at Blackhall strange at first, it being broken work in some of the districts, the other districts being arc walls, which was quite pleasant being able to walk around without bending. I had been at Blackhall approximately two years when the mastershifter told me the undermanager wanted to see me. All that night I tried to think what I had done wrong for the undermanager wanting to see me, but could not find any answer. The following afternoon I reported to the office and Mr Sparks asked me if I would consider joining the Colliery Rescue Brigade. If I passed the medical examination I would have to report to the Rescue Station at Houghton each Thursday for fourteen weeks and would receive ten shillings plus bus fares, money for old rope, so he said. I agreed and was instructed to report to the Medical Officer the following afternoon. After being turned inside out by the doctor, I was declared fit for Rescue Work and told to report to Houghton the following week to commence training, which I really enjoyed. The training took the form of lectures and gradually to working two hours wearing the apparatus. After training the programme consisted of four time at the Rescue Station and two underground practices at different collieries yearly. On the 22nd May 1951 we were at Easington Colliery for one of these underground practices and were descending with the backshift men when I heard one of these men say &#8216;Look at these lot, they don't half fancy themselves with that gear on.' The practice was completed and the remark forgotten about. 29th May 1951 that terrible explosion took place and the Rescue Brigade called out to the pit. Receiving word to proceed to Easington I felt anything but brave, but I had been trained for the work therefore I was needed. Arriving at the Colliery another deputy from Blackhall, A Brown was there and three rescue men from Whitburn Colliery made up the team, one of these had done his training with me. After a medical examination we prepared our breathing apparatus and had to wait our turn to descend the mine. Eventually what seemed like ages our time came, proceeding up the shaft sidings we turned left into the seam where the explosion had occurred and came face to face with the biggest fall of stone I have ever seen, the full landing had collapsed leaving an unprotected road over the top of about four feet. It was found later that this fall had saved the rest of the colliery. After negotiating this fall we proceeded up a drift where the heavy &#8216;H' girders had not just been blown out, but had also been twisted like a corkscrew, further up this drift an engine house had been built and four young boys were found burned almost to ashes. Reaching the fresh air base a team was waiting for us and as soon as we arrived they moved up to the advance fresh air base. Soon after we arrived another team came from the surface and it was our turn to move up. The operation was supervised by Mr Richardson from the Rescue Station and the procedure was that one team had to be standing by, before another team was allowed to enter the noxious gas, and then retired back to base and then on to the surface. The first two days were spent looking for anyone who may have been fortunate enough to have missed the blast, but everyone knew this was an impossibility, so we tried to restore the natural ventilation by the use of canvas strappings etc. On the Friday morning when we arrived at the advance base Mr Richardson asked if we do a favour and disembowel a dead pony which was beginning to smell. The three men from Whitburn refused saying they were not butchers, I was no butcher and no braver than anyone else, but if this was going to help the rescue operation it had to be done, A Brown said he would help me and the others would carry the lime etc for us. I was given an old army knife and a drawing axe and a shovel to do the job with. Strikin the knife into the pony I tried to follow a straight line but with the knife being blunt this was a difficult task, eventually we managed to disembowel it and fill it with lime to help burn it away. Completing the task we were told by the doctor (there was always one underground) to call at the Surface Medical Centre to &#8216; Have something out of the bottle' this being the first taste of brandy I had ever had. Saturday we had to report at twelve noon, and on this day a good number of funerals were taking place. The NCB van taking us into the pit yard had to stop because of the crowds and it was pitiful when women got hold of you crying and asking if we had seen their husbands or sons. Reporting to the office we were ordered down the pit immediately, making us very popular with the other teams already waiting, this being Saturday afternoon. Arriving at the fresh air base Mr Richardson and the doctor were waiting for us. We asked what all the fuss and rush was about and we were informed that another pony had been found and would we please treat it the same as the other , the only difference being it was in the fresh air and the doctor would very kindly loan us a scalpel and would accompany us. I must say that this made the job much cleaner and quicker, more so that we took two of its legs off as well. This was our shortest shift instead of being there twelve to thirteen hours we were there just six. We always seemed to get the best of shifts, Sunday five pm arriving at the pit we were informed that the three men from Whitburn had been sent for at five am this made me see red and to cap it all one of the full time Rescue Men informed us that they were going to send a team with me and a team with A Brown. It appeared that the doctor's had failed half of the men and reinforcements had been brought in from Northumberland. After our medicals we refused to be separated, going down there you wanted someone you could trust without being disrespectful to the Northumberland people. We were asked if we would take a team with us which we couldn't very well refuse. These people were laughing and joking amongst themselves and thought it all a big joke. I thought to myself wait until you get down there and then let us see you laugh. When it came to our turn to go into the gas we were filling our apparatus with liquid air instead of the regulation five and a half pounds I used to fill mine until it ran over, I was carrying overweight but I have a little in reserve. I mentioned this to the men but they took no notice. Arriving at the district meeting station I could not believe my eyes for what I saw, there were twenty seven bodies in various forms of undress making ready to go to the face when the blast had struck them. The deputy was lying face down and after drawing a pin man on the roof (everything had to be drawn whatever was found ready for when the surveyors could map everything out) we proceed to prepare a stretcher, now it was impossible to speak wearing the apparatus but by signs A Brown would lift the body by his belt while the stretcher was placed under him. As soon as the body was being lifted the little air left in his lungs escaped and the rest of the team turned tail leaving A Brown and myself. We loaded the body onto the stretcher and proceeded outbye and arriving at the fresh air base each of the standby team were filling their apparatus to come and look for us. Putting the stretcher down and taking our mouthpieces out we tried to answer the thousand and one questions that were being thrown at us, asking where our team mates were we were informed that if they were still going as fast they would be at the surface, that was the last we saw of them, and it came to my mind that the so called joke had backfired on them, bringing the horrific job to reality for them. One outstanding incident stands out in my mind, after the medical on Monday we were water testing our apparatus when I noticed air bubbles escaping from the brass tubes, I pointed this out to the regular rescue man and he said it would be alright. I immediately told him I was not depending on it, needless to say I obtained another apparatus. By this time the majority of the bodies had been recovered and we were engaged with the colliery deputies erecting and strengthening the strappings while we had the breathing apparatus and the birds with us we were more or less working in fresh air. We were there to give the deputies confidence, so we were told. This went on for a couple of days and then we were back into the noxious atmosphere. Travelling one of the roadways we came a cross a kibble welded to the roof emphasising the terrible heat that must have been caused by the explosion. One afternoon walking across the pit a group of men were standing and seeing the team they came across and gave us a couple of bottles of Newcastle Brown Ale, I didn't think I could enjoy drinking this as I had never tasted it before, but it was like nectar to my tongue. On the Thursday Mr Fry the group manager at Blackhall was at Easington and while we were at the advance base he asked us to synchronise our watches with his and if he was not back to base within twenty minutes to go and look for him. Refusing all offers for us to accompany him he went into a side road, he was back very shortly and reported he could smell a body under a fall of stone, the body was recovered and it was a Wheatley Hill resident who had worked under me at Wheatley Hill Colliery. Friday we were told to report back to the colliery where we were employed. It must be said the NCB looked after us well enough, sparing no cost we were even sent sandwiches and tea down the pit for us. Of course it has to be borne in mind that we were in the mine for a period of twelve to thirteen hours each day. The sandwiches were ham and lettuce which in itself was alright, but the Easington workmen working backbye were taking the ham and leaving just lettuce for us. Arriving at the surface each day the team man who had acted as captain that day made out a report while the rest of us were interrogated. While this was going on we were given twenty cigarettes each while we waited for our turn, this was very good as cigarettes were scare at that time. I have written this out at the request of my good friend Jim Hughes, but after thirty years I am afraid that some of the incidents have escaped my memory. Being there for the whole fortnight I can only thank god that I came through satisfactory not like the two unfortunate rescue men who lost their lives.</comment>

        <comment>I assume you are aware of who this is? It is of course John Donkin Dormand (1919 - 2003) who succeeded Manny Shinwell as MP for Easington, rose to become Labour Chief Whip and eventually went into the House of Lords as Lord Dormand of Easington. He was born at Haswell, educated at Wellfield A J Dawson Grammar School as well as other illustrious seats of learning such as Oxford University. The date of 1937 would seem to be correct as he would then be 18.</comment>

        <comment>Comment: My dad is on the back row, fourth from the left - William (Billy) Bamborough. He worked here for 30 years; I have photographs of his ICI 30 year presentation. I am writing my memoires for my grandchildren and discovered this web site more or less by chance. I am so grateful to you as it helps me fill in some gaps and also to leave them with interesting information about their great-grandad.</comment>

        <comment>When was this photo taken? From 1940 to 1944, my mother and us 3 children lived in this cottage whilst my father was in the Army. I have a photograph of my father digging the garden with Pig Hill in the background and the garden was full of vegetables. Other photos showed us around the cottage at various times. There is one b/w photo of mother and baby brother in the doorway during the winter - the cottage was snowbound. I remember quite a few things about living here ( I and my sister attended Easington Lane school whilst we lived here - travelling by ourselves through the woods to get the bus near Elemore Colliery everyday). Before the war, my father was chauffeur to Lady Baker-Baker at Elemore Hall and my youngest brother was born at the Hall.</comment>

        <comment>This building was Sailors Hall (built in the 18th century)and not Mill Farm. It was located about 200 yds south of Hawthorn Towers and 100 yds west of Hawthorn viaduct. By 1926 it was unoccupied and fell into disrepair. It is now overgrown and anyone unaware of its location, would not know that a building had once stood there</comment>

        <comment>The towers has it back to the cliff tops and the railway which is not very far away. The cliff tops would be a matter of just about 150-200 yards away behind the house. My mother was in service for the Pembertons during the mid to late 40s and lived in at the house.</comment>

        <comment>This photo again clearly shows "Garden House" the three storey quaker school which during my time in the village was the Newby family home. In 1980 I worked with Mick Newby rebuilding the wall plates and roof and it was obvious at that time the 3rd storey had been low cost flats housing 4 families in a tiny space. The small cottage connected to the side of the house was a ruin when I was a child but like the cottage on the other end has been rebuilt.</comment>

Most of the starboard side can be seen . There is a long stepladder going down to the water with some person(s) on it near the bottom. A boat is moored there.The neg. is reasoably well exposed and I will send a print to the archive</comment>

        <comment>I believe the road ahead is West Lane now lined with houses down the left hand side. Turning right would have taken you down Eagle Hall bank and on to Easington Village. Turning left would have taken you through Cold Hesledon. The road behind you went to Hetton-le Hole.</comment>

        <comment>Yes its the top end of Third Street, the chippy is still there and still in the same family. The first shop on the photograph was a bakers Creggs I think. All I know is my ma would send me there for breakfast. Warm fresh Tea Cakes and Butter. The butter came as one large block and the assistant cut off what you wanted. Yum Yum. In the distance the White building was a pub the Northeastern I think.</comment>

        <comment>It is not 1950l Look at the date on the postcard . It reads either 1943 or 45. Shotton Road was known locally as Ellisons Bank. By the 1950s there should be housing on the hill and Chapel Hill Road should just be visible near Cracknells Farm that later became the British Legion. This road used to be a toll road way back in time.</comment>

        <comment>The Mordues in the photograph are on the left Jack Mordue and on the right Mick Mordue (my great grandfather) who was killed at Gallipoli in 1915, so the photo is probably about right. Jack was capped for England football team twice and died in 1938. They were reknowned in the North East for their handball skills and a search on the internet reveals a lot moe information. Too much for me to write about! But heres a quote from the Mordues family tree (currently being updated by my mams cousin, grandson of Jack)... In 'Horden Miners' Mr A. Pratt describes in his own words: "Micky Mordue was on deputy work at Horden Colliery when war broke out. He joined up in August 1914 and went down in Dardanelles in 1915. The other one, Jacky Mordue played football for Sunderland. The Mordues were world famous for their handball playing. The two Mordues played against the three Stones brothers, that was four hands against six hands and that was the only way people would play them. It was a game where a lot of brute strength was required. They would use brute strength with cuteness. They trained before the big match for weeks, hitting the ball against the alley, from one corner to another. I have seen a match go on for six hours. They played it on every street corner and gable-end. If they thought they were good enough they would try for a game on the big alley for money. The players would travel right around. Trapper Charlton, Pauly Tennant, Jacky Cook, Trapper Harkness - all from Horden with the Mordues, and all good players".</comment>

        <comment>The clock was a memorial for war dead. (Cannot remember it ever working)The poppy day parade used to muster there. The bus in the background will be from the garage/coach business next door to the Legion. -Select coaches. The garage was a t one time ( late 1940s )a fire station.</comment>

        <comment>For many years in the late '40s/early'50s my mother was treasurer of the Women's Section. I cannot identify any of the people in the picture. However, the bus in the background was probably one belonging the the garage next door which I think operated under the name 'Select Coaches'.</comment>

        <comment>I was a Pentecostal in the 1950s and attended the Chapel behind the Police Station, which later became the the Comrades Club. I don't know when it was opened but it was a relatively small wooden building and I have no recollection of it having the double doors shown in the picture, the entrace being quite small at the back of the Chapel. I wonder if this picture is of the opening of the new Church built much later in Sunderland Road. The gentleman on the left could be Mr Wilson, the Sunday School superintendant and the lady next to him could be Mrs Marsden.</comment>

        <comment>This looks very much like First Street, where I lived as a child and young man for over 20 years. It is probably the only one of the numbered streets that had such a view of the colliery cooling towers and it did have the slight rise and fall clearly shown in the picture.</comment>

        <comment>I think it is first street. I lived in second street as a boy and at the far end of the street where the miners pay office which would have been in full view also First street ended a full block before the other streets which can be seen on the right. I am sure the houses at the far end which are very faint is the start of Eden Street</comment>

        <comment>Is this not St. Andrews Terrace, Cold Hesledon? I only ask because I worked for Easington District Council in the 1970s and did all the administrative work for the Compulsory Purchase and demolition of houses at Cold Hesledon. Cold Hesledon had its own Parish Council until it was taken over by East Murton in about 1980.</comment>

Could be Jones the Cobblers, later to be run by his son in law Bob Irving as a general dealer and then a wet fish shop added.</comment>

        <comment>The picture is indeed of St. Paul's Methodist Church, Murton. The low building and the building with the cross are one in the same, the actual church. The altar and organ are in the area marked with the cross. The building with the round-headed windows is the old church hall, used for shows and Sunday School. I attended the church and Sunday School in the 70's and 80's.</comment>

        <comment>The two girls in the bottom right of the photo were identical twins (only family could tell them apart - one was my gran!). They are Isabell and Ethel Morton, the youngest of 5 children in the family. They we're born on 29th February 1922 (Identical twins and born on 29th February - fairly unusual). Their elder brother was Jack Morton who won the DFC during WWII (My mother has a scrap book of information on this so I'll speak to her about showing it to you). As a point of interest my gran (Ethel) was married to Edward Holland (also of Murton) who was born on exactly the same day, but from what I understand she was a few hours older. Although my gran passed away some years ago, my auntie still live's in Murton and took great pleasure when we showed her the photo the other week (I'd like to thank you for that). She even remembered the names of all but one set of the twins. From what I've been told by my family (only now) there was a fair bit of media interest at the time as twins didn't happen that often, yet in Murton there were several sets in only a few years.</comment>

        <comment>The lady is standing in the "Demey Field)", where the Federation Square Prefabs were later built. To the right of Harrogate Terrace the steelwork frame used during the construction of the Rex Cinema can be seen. Edison Street is also visible sloping left to right across the photograph. The Rex was built in 1939, so this dates the photograph approximately around this date.</comment>

        <comment>This Pic of Fine Fare Foundations at the Earliest was 1972. I lived in Beyond the shell garage and used to walk to town through the underpasses across this field. It was also a site that was used to put on displays.</comment>

        <comment>I lived in Peterlee all my life and should point out that Pic was taken late 60's early seventies. If you look in the background no hi rise old Asda store wich opened Sept 1974 or 75 as construction was a year that places the Pic at least 1973 at latest.</comment>

        <comment>Comment: Kevin Jones, what a gentleman. First met him around 1990 while training at the Kushiro Karate Club (Lowhills Road Leisure Centre). He was elderly chap and trained purely for fitness. Haven't seen Kevin for quite some years now, last I heard he was being cared for in a local nursing home. Lovely man and someone I will never forget.</comment>

        <comment>This is later than 1969 as girls were not permitted to wear trousers at this time. I left this school in 1968. It was not until roughly the mid 70s that girls wore trousers as part of the uniform. I taught at another secondary school in Peterlee and remember the staff discussing just such a move.</comment>

        <comment>My Great Grandma and Grandad - Emily &amp; Marshall Irving were with the Salvation Army until they could not get there any longer. Unfortunatly my Granda Marshall passed away in 1992 at the age of 92 and sadly my Grandma Emily passed away in Jan 2007 aged 95. They are greatly missed but together. It would be nice to hear from anybody who knew them as they played a big part in my life and my siblings life and parents life</comment>

The lady with with a baby on her knee is my grandmother Esther Steel (1899) the baby boy is my father George Albert Steel (born January 1937) The lady behind Esther Steel, on the right with grey hair is my great grandmother Jane Campbell. The lady in the back row( holding a little girl) was called Grace Hope</comment>

        <comment>The picture is deceptive. The house was a shop and cafe at the bottom of the path. The path still exists.In front was a large concrete shelf and in the nineteenth century there was a battery of cannons on the shelf, which were manned by the Volunteers. One of their officers was a Mr Venner. His son was the long time Head Scout Leader of the local troup.</comment>

        <comment>I believe that the first pit sunk at the "Nack" was called Seaton Colliery and the town to the west was Seaton. The Pub received a direct hit by a bomb in second world war, kiling several people. It was later rebuilt - hence the name "Phoenix", the bird which arose from the ashes.</comment>

    <description>Photograph of approximately fifteen boys wearing peaked caps and carrying musical instruments, accompanied by six men in uniform, also carrying musical instruments; the group is standing outside a public house, identified as "the Station Hotel, Shotton"; three children and a man in the doorway of the public house are watching the group; the group is described as "Shotton Colliery Band", but its members seem to be wearing the same uniforms as the members of the band in shot0077, 78, 79,; the photograph has been identified as having been taken on "Armistice Day 1942", an event unknown to history, so it may be that the occasion for the photograph was Victory in Europe Day, 8 May 1945; the hypothesis that the photograph was taken during the era of the Second World War is borne out by the fact that most of the members of the band are children</description>

        <comment>It looks like the man with the shovel is clearing the gummings. The shortwall cutters were mainly used in room and pillar working. Unlike the longwall cutter, whose cutting jib was pivoted to allow it to be swung round at the front of the machine so that it could be locked into position perpendicular to the main body of the machine, the jib on the shortwall cutter was in-line with the body and ran underneath it so that the cutting debris, the 'gummings' were ejected at the back.</comment>

        <comment>Change to previous comment The electricity pylons in the picture suggest the site of this activity is on the Murton side of South Hetton in the vicinity of the Combined Pit. The activity could again be the removal of railway embankment. The date 1970-79 would then make more sense. Again recent local knowledge required.</comment>

        <comment>There is no river and hence they are not fishing. The old railway track from South Hetton to Haswell was constructed from pit waste. I seem to recall that much of it was taken away for commercial use in the 50s. Is this what is going on? Comment from someone with more recent local knowledge might help.</comment>

        <comment>We think this photgraph was from the 1974 miners strike when people were digging coal out from beside the old railway line. There is no river in South Hetton!</comment>

        <comment>The pub is in fact The Railway Inn, (see Sout0026) although the pub sign is different. It ceased to be a pub long before the 1940s. The Hope &amp; Anchor was further down the street.</comment>

        <comment>This is perhaps looking along one of the Cross Rows West, perhaps Braddyl Street, from Front Street. I find the date surprising; I would have thought it was much earlier than 1970 but could well be wrong.</comment>

        <comment>i think this photograph is of Church Street on the left. the next Terrace would be Front Street. The road on the right was known as 'the cutting', steps up to the cooperative store on the right from this road are still there. A railway bridge went across this road. The road leads inton Wingate Front Street.</comment>

        <comment>This appears to have been taken from Holcrofts corner, looking south. The school is indeed on the right, Boys and Girls separated, built if memory serves correct, in 1877. It was a Community Center in the 1970's on, until demolished and the present Center built. Holy Trinity Church would be to the left of the camera.</comment>
